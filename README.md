# T.Crypto

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-token.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-sale.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-collectable.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-voter.js --network goerli
npx hardhat help
```
